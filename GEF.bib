	Abstract = {An adaptive {ADER} finite volume method on unstructured meshes is
	proposed. The method combines high order polyharmonic spline weighted
	essentially non-oscillatory ({WENO}) reconstruction with high order
	flux evaluation. Polyharmonic splines are utilized in the recovery
	step of the finite volume method yielding a {WENO} reconstruction
	that is stable, flexible, and optimal in the associated Sobolev (Beppo-Levi)
	space. The flux evaluation is accomplished by solving generalized
	Riemann problems across cell interfaces. The mesh adaptation is performed
	through an a posteriori error indicator, which relies on the polyharmonic
	spline reconstruction scheme. The performance of the proposed method
	is illustrated by a series of numerical experiments, including linear
	advection, Burgers's equation, Smolarkiewicz's deformational flow
	test, and the five-spot problem., An adaptive {ADER} finite volume

	meshless collocation methods which emphasis on recent novel kernel
	{RBFs} and new numerical schemes for solving partial differential

	on the numerical algorithms, engineering applications, and highlights
	a large class of novel boundary-type {RBF} meshless collocation methods.
	These methods have shown a clear edge over the traditional numerical
	techniques especially for problems involving infinite domain, moving
	boundary, thin-walled structures, and inverse problems. Due to the
	rapid development in {RBF} meshless collocation methods, there is
	a need to summarize all these new materials so that they are available
	to scientists, engineers, and graduate students who are interest
	to apply these newly developed methods for solving real worlds problems.

	Abstract = {{SVM} training is a convex optimization problem which scales with
	the training set size rather than the feature space dimension. While
	this is usually considered to be a desired quality, in large scale
	problems it may cause training to be impractical. The common techniques
	to handle this difficulty basically build a solution by solving a
	sequence of small scale subproblems. Our current effort is concentrated
	on the rank of the kernel matrix as a source for further enhancement
	of the training procedure. We first show that for a low rank kernel
	matrix it is possible to design a better interior point method ({IPM)}
	in terms of storage requirements as well as computational complexity.
	We then suggest an efficient use of a known factorization technique
	to approximate a given kernel matrix by a low rank matrix, which
	in turn will be used to feed the optimizer. Finally, we derive an
	upper bound on the change in the objective function value based on
	the approximation error and the number of active constraints (support
	vectors). This bound is general in the sense that it holds regardless
	of the approximation method.},

	Abstract = {Radial basis functions are used in the recovery step of finite volume
	methods for the numerical solution of conservation laws. Being conditionally
	positive definite such functions generate optimal recovery splines
	in the sense of Micchelli and Rivlin in associated native spaces.
	We analyse the solvability to the recovery problem of point functionals
	from cell average values with radial basis functions. Furthermore,
	we characterise the corresponding native function spaces and provide
	error estimates of the recovery scheme. Finally, we explicitly list
	the native spaces to a selection of radial basis functions, thin
	plate splines included, before we provide some numerical examples
	of our method.},

@article{MorrisEtAl93,
	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This article is concerned with the problem
	of predicting a deterministic response function y0 over a multidimensional
	domain T, given values of y0 and all of its first derivatives at
	a set of design sites (points) in T. The intended application is
	to computer experiments in which y0 is an output from a computer
	model of a physical system and each point in T represents a particular
	configuration of the input parameters. It is assumed that the first
	derivatives are already available (e. g., from a sensitivity analysis)
	or can be produced by the code that implements the model. A Bayesian
	approach in which the random function that represents prior uncertainty
	about y0 is taken to be a stationary Gaussian stochastic process
	is used. The calculations needed to update the prior given observations
	of y0 and its first derivatives at the design sites are given and
	are illustrated in a small example. The issue of experimental design
	is also discussed, in particular the criterion of maximizing the
	reduction in entropy, which leads to a kind of D optimality. It is
	shown that, for certain classes of correlation functions in which
	the intersite correlations are very weak, D-optimal designs necessarily
	maximize the minimim distance between design sites. A simulated annealing
	algorithm is described for constructing such maximin distance designs.
	An example is given based on a demonstration model of eight inputs
	and one output, in which predictions based on a maximin design, a
	Latin hypercube design, and two compromise designs are evaluated
	and compared.},
