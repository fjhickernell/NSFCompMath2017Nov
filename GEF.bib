  abstract = {In this paper we present the theoretical framework needed to justify
	the use of a kernel-based collocation method (meshfree approximation
	method) to estimate the solution of high-dimensional stochastic partial
	differential equations ({SPDEs).} Using an implicit time-stepping
	scheme, we transform stochastic parabolic equations into stochastic
	elliptic equations. Our main attention is concentrated on the numerical
	solution of the elliptic equations at each time step. The estimator
	of the solution of the elliptic equations is given as a linear combination
	of reproducing kernels derived from the differential and boundary
	operators of the {SPDE} centred at collocation points to be chosen
	by the user. The random expansion coefficients are computed by solving
	a random system of linear equations. Numerical experiments demonstrate
	the feasibility of the method.},

  journal = {{SIAM} J. Sci. Comput.},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {34},
  pages = {A737---A762},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {We provide a new way to compute and evaluate Gaussian radial basis
	function interpolants in a stable way with a special focus on small
	values of the shape parameter, i.e., for ``flat'' kernels. This work
	is motivated by the fundamental ideas proposed earlier by Bengt Fornberg
	and his co-workers. However, following Mercer's theorem, an {\$L\_2({\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d},
	{\textbackslash}rho)\$-orthonormal expansion of the Gaussian kernel
	allows us to come up with an algorithm that is simpler than the one
	proposed by Fornberg, Larsson and Flyer and that is applicable in
	arbitrary space dimensions \$d\$. In addition to obtaining an accurate
	approximation of the {RBF} interpolant (using many terms in the series
	expansion of the kernel) we also propose and investigate a highly
	accurate least-squares approximation based on early truncation of
	the kernel expansion.},

	elliptic stochastic partial differential equations driven by Gaussian
	noises. The kernel-based collocation solution is a linear combination
	of reproducing kernels not only done with related differential and
	boundary operators but also centered at chosen collocation points.
	Its random coefficients are solved by a random linear equation systems.
	The finite element solution is a tensor product of triangular finite
	element bases and Lagrange polynomials defined on a finite dimensional
	probability space. Its coefficients are solved by serval deterministic
	finite element problems. For the kernel-based collocation methods,
	we can simulate the Gaussian noise at the collocation points directly.
	But we need to truncate the Gaussian noises into finite dimensional
	noises for the finite element methods. According to our numerical
	experiments, the finite element methods have the same convergent
	rate as the kernel-based collocation methods if the Gaussian noises
	are truncated by the suitable terms.},
