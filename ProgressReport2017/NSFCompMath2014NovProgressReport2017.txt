%% Accomplishments
% Major Goals

This research is comprised of four projects related to function approximation and integration:

1. Extending our research on the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD by identifying more kernels and their Mercer series for which the Hilbert-SVD can be implemented,

2. Extending our research on guaranteed, adaptive algorithms, 

3. Obtaining guaranteed, adaptive algorithms for kernel methods, and 

4. Applying our new results to various problems.

% Major Activities

Project 1. 
a) Fasshauer collaborated with Jalil Rashidinia and Manoochehr Khasi on an alternative approach to implementing Hilbert-Schmidt eigenfunctions of the Gaussian kernel by using Chebyshev polynomials instead of Hermite polynomials in the expansion used in our earlier work. This enhances the numerical stability of the algorithm. This new eigenfunction representation was also applied to the numerical solution of nonlinear unsteady convection-diffusion-reaction equations.

b) Fasshauer has been collaborating with Paul Martin to extend an earlier derivation for eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the $C^0$ Matern kernel on the half line from Fasshauer and McCourt (2015) to the entire real line. Extensions to smoother Matern kernels are currently being investigated. 

Project 2. 
a) Hickernell and and Lluis Antoni Jiménez Rugama improved the earlier work by Hickernell and Jiang on relative and hybrid error tolerances.  We found a better way to determine the best estimate of the integral, which is not necessarily the sample mean.  By “better” we mean an answer that satisfies a tighter error tolerance for both adaptive IID Monte Carlo and adaptive quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms.

b) Hickernell, Jiménez Rugama, and Da Li published their work implementing control variates for quasi-Monte Carlo.

c) Hickernell and Jiménez Rugama also extended the work on hybrid error bounds to methods for estimating a function of integrals within a given error tolerance.  Such problems arise in Bayesian inference and Sobol’ indices.

d) Hickernell, Sou-Cheng Choi, Yuhan Ding and Xin Tong published their work on locally adaptive function approximation and optimization and implemented it in the Guaranteed Automatic Integration Library (GAIL) MATLAB toolbox.

e) Hickernell, Li, and Jiménez Rugama have been developing a guaranteed, adaptive quasi-Monte Carlo method that incorporates control variates.  One non-trivial challenge is that the optimal coefficient of the control variate is not the same for quasi-Monte Carlo methods as it is for IID Monte Carlo methods.  Li has completed his master's thesis on this topic.

f) Undergraduate students Yueyi Li and Cu Hauw Hung have been exploring internal control variates based on several 

Project 3.
a) Hickernell and Jagadeeswaran Rathinavel have been investigating Bayesian cubature for adaptively integrating multivariate functions.  We have also discovered a deterministic (non-Bayesian) context, which mimics kernel methods for integration.  We are focusing on kernels of a special form related to the low discrepancy point set that allow one to perform the matrix inversion and eigenvalue decomposition in O(n \log n) operations.  In some cases this requires variable transformations

b) Now that Bayesian cubature is showing promise, we will also explore function approximation using these special kernels for function approximation. 

Project 4.
a) Fasshauer extended his collaboration with P.K. Mishra, S.K. Nath and M.K. Sen to the numerical solution of partial differential equations with a kernel-based finite difference method based on the hybrid radial kernel composed of a Gaussian part along with a cubic part studied in a previous paper. In particular, a geophysics application to the solution of a frequency-domain wave equation was investigated.

b) In the collaboration with J. Rashidinia and M. Khasi mentioned earlier, Fasshauer applied the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD for Gaussian kernels in a new Chebyshev polynomial-based representation to the numerical solution of nonlinear unsteady convection-diffusion-reaction equations.

c) Fasshauer collaborated with Mike McCourt on an application of product iterated Brownian bridge kernels formed with the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD to a black box Bayesian optimization algorithm following the sequential kriging approach.

d) Fasshauer is collaborating with Brad Martin, Atef Elsherbeni and Mohammed Hadi on the application of interface-aware kernel-based finite difference methods to the numerical solution of 2D Maxwell equations as they apply to problems in antenna design.

e) Fasshauer is supervising an REU project with Paul Wolfert on the use of kernel-based numerical methods for space-time collocation.

f) Together with Alessandra De Rossi, Roberto Cavoretto and Emma Perracchione, Fasshauer is developing an anisotropic partition of unity method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.

g) Undergraduate Tianci Zhu and MS student Xiaoyang Zhao have been working to implement the QE approximation to the Heston model for stock price paths.  They hope to facilitate automatic computation of option prices to fit a predefined error tolerance using our adaptive routines in the GAIL toolbox.

h) Jiménez Rugama has been collaborating with scientists at Fermilab to use our adaptive quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms for computations in high energy physics.  Erratic changes in the values of the multi-dimensional integrals as the sample size increased highlighted long-overlooked bugs in the existing code.

i) Jiménez Rugama and Hickernell have been collaborating with Clementine Prieur and her group on efficient computation of Sobol' indices, used in uncertainty quantification.

% Specific Objectives
Project 1. 
a) We want to enhance the numerical stability and computational efficiency of the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD for Gaussian kernels. The idea is to use a "better" basis for the polynomial part of the eigenfunctions and exploit special properties of eigenfunctions, such as their orthogonality and location of their zeros. The use of Chebyshev polynomials instead of Hermite polynomials has provided some success. 

b) Using various techniques from the classical theory of integral equations and known facts about special functions (such as Bessel functions), we want to make progress on the analytical derivation of eigenfunction expansions for kernels widely used in practice such as the family of Matern kernels, which is popular both in the statistics and numerical analysis communities.

Project 2. 
a) Because 

b) Now that we have constructed a low order algorithm for univariate approximation and optimization, we would like to extend these ideas to univariate quadrature.  We also want to construct algorithms with higher order accuracy.

c) The goal is to make the use of control variates in adaptive quasi-Monte Carlo seamless.  This includes finding the right way to compute the optimal control variate coefficient.  A related goal is to accommodate cases like American options, where the payoff for a particular stock path does not depend on that one path only, but on the exercise boundary, which itself must be estimated using all paths.

d) The GAIL toolbox showcases our algorithms and makes them available for others to use.  They are used extensively in the Monte Carlo class taught by Hickernell each fall.  The work done by the BSMP students and Qian was designed to enhance the features of our GAIL toolbox.

Project 4.
a) The objective is to allow option pricing to a user-defined error tolerance via (quasi-) Monte Carlo with this more realistic stochastic volatility model.  In the course of their work, Zhao and Zhu found that existing code gives poor accuracy for small volatility of the variance of the asset price.  They needed to modify the algorithm to correct this error.

b) The objective of the collaboration between Jiménez Rugama and Fermilab is to apply more advanced techniques to speed up computation of the integrals required to infer from the observed data the most likely particle interactions that are occurring.

c) We want to use our automatic Sobol' cubature algorithm to compute them to a desired accuracy requirement.  One challenge is that the Sobol' indices are defined as a function of more than one integral.  This complicates satisfying the error tolerance.

d) The recent monograph by Fasshauer and McCourt has served as the foundation for looking at kernel-based methods from both a deterministic and stochastic perspective, and then apply insights gained in one domain to the other.

e) Applying insights gained in recent work on kernel-based approximation methods to the design of hybrid kernels may lead to new and improved kernel methods for interpolation and collocation algorithms.

f) Similar to (d), insights gained by looking at numerical algorithms also from a statistical perspective may lead to new and improved numerical algorithms which can be applied in many different situations - here an MFS-based coupled PDE solver whose source points are selected using an LOOCV-like algorithm.

g) Since radial basis function methods can be interpreted as generalizations of polynomial methods much that was previously done with polynomials (such as finite difference methods) can also be done in more generality - and hopefully more accurately and/or efficiently - with kernel-based methods. 


% Significant Results
Project 1. 
a) A paper has been submitted that details the new Chebyshev polynomial-based eigenfunction representation of the Gaussian kernel and uses this representation to solve nonlinear unsteady convection-diffusion-reaction equations.

b) So far, we have been able to extend earlier results for low-order Matern kernels from the half-line to the entire real line. We are looking for ways to "lift" the techniques to accomplish this to the case of higher-order Matern kernels before preparing a paper on the topic.

Project 2. 
a) The adaptive IID Monte Carlo algorithm with a hybrid error tolerance has been implemented in GAIL.  A manuscript will be prepared for publication.

b) The new algorithm for univariate optimization has computational cost that is proportional to \sqrt{||f''||_{1/2}/\epsilon}, where \epsilon is the desired error tolerance.  This can be significantly smaller than the \sqrt{||f''||_{\infty}/\epsilon} cost of globally adaptive algorithms, because the 1/2-quasi-norm of a somewhat spiky function may be much smaller than the sup-norm of that same function.  The asymptotic optimality of our algorithm has been established.  A manuscript submitted for publication has received positive reviews and is being revised.

c) By computing the discrete Fourier Walsh coefficients, it is possible to compute the optimal control variate coefficient as the function is being sampled, and in a way consistent with earlier observations by Hickernell, Lemieux, and Owen (2005).  Problems like American options are solved by using all function data to compute the exercise boundary, which means re-computing all payoffs each time additional stock paths are generated.  Li's thesis will be written up for publication.

d) The work by Qian may be written up for publication.  The work by the BSMP students will be part of the next release of GAIL.

Project 4.
a) A joint paper has been submitted to a geophysics journal presenting the kernel-based finite difference method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations with the hybrid Gaussian-cubic kernel studied earlier.

b) A joint paper has been submitted that discusses the numerical solution of nonlinear unsteady convection-diffusion-reaction equations with the new Chebyshev polynomial-based representation of the Gaussian eigenfunctions within the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD algorithm.

c) Fasshauer and McCourt each gave presentations black box Bayesian optimization algorithm using the iterated Brownian bridge product kernels.

d) A joint paper for an electrical engineering journal is in preparation that compares the use of interface-aware kernel-based finite difference methods to standard finite difference methods for the 2D Maxwell equations as they apply to problems in antenna design.

*** OLD ***
a) By altering the approximation to the integral of the variance, they avoided amplified errors for small volatility of the variance.  The modified algorithm provides more accurate answers.  This work will form part of Xiaoyang Zhao's MS thesis.

b) In the course of his work with Fermilab, Jiménez Rugama discovered the the MATLAB's own versions of the Sobol' sequence had been incorrectly coded.  This error and the suggested fix were brought to the attention of the Mathworks.

% Key Outcomes and Achievements

Project 2. 
a) This is the first instance we know of where the computational cost of an adaptive algorithm is expressed in terms of a quasi-norm, as we have found.  The popular Chebfun package, which performs numerical computations on Chebyshev polynomial approximations of functions, does not have guarantees that the answers they provide satisfy a given error tolerance.  Our algorithms have such guarantees.

b) Guaranteed quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms have been extended to take advantage of control variates.

%% What are we planning to do

Several of the work mentioned above is in need of being written up and submitted for publication.  As we do that, we will clarify our results.

We want to extend all of our existing algorithms to include relative error tolerances.  This has been done for some.

We want to extend our low convergence order guaranteed algorithms for univariate problems to higher order.  This involved moving from linear splines to higher order piecewise polynomial approximations or high degree polynomial approximations using Chebyshev nodes.

We want to further explore and exploit the interplay between the deterministic and stochastic perspective of various algorithms. 

We want to look at Bayesian cubature.  This method is related to function approximation by kernel methods, and it may be easier to construct adaptive Bayesian cubature algorithms (Project 2), and then use the lessons gained for adaptive function approximation (Project 3).

%%% Impact
%% Impact on the principle disciplines
This project has developed adaptive algorithms for univariate and multivariate integration, for univariate function approximation, and for univariate optimization.  Unlike  other popular algorithms such as those in the Chebfun toolbox, our algorithms are theoretically justified.  A paradigm has been established for rigorously analyzing the error of adaptive algorithms, and the important details are being worked out for various cases.  The computational costs of these new adaptive algorithms depend in some surprising ways on the quasi-norm of the function being integrated, approximated, or optimized.


%% Impact on other disciplines
The basic operations of integration, function approximation, and optimization are used in a number of application areas in finance, engineering and science.  We are providing more efficient, robust and convenient tools, which will expedite the discovery of new science.
